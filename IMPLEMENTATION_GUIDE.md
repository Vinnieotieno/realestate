### Test the API
```bash
# Get authentication token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api-token-auth/ \
  -d "username=admin&password=password"

# Use token in requests
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/property-management/properties/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
- Check email configuration in settings.py
- Verify email credentials
- Check Django logs for errors
- Test with `python manage.py shell` and send a test email

### API Not Working
- Ensure rest_framework is installed: `pip install djangorestframework`
- Check that rest_framework is in INSTALLED_APPS
- Verify authentication token is included in requests
- Check API URLs are properly configured

### Database Issues
- Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate property_management`
- Check for migration conflicts
- Verify database connection

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Email**: Set up email credentials for notifications
2. **Create Test Data**: Add properties, tenants, and maintenance tasks
3. **Test API**: Use the API endpoints to verify functionality
4. **Customize Templates**: Modify email templates to match your branding
5. **Deploy**: Deploy to production with proper email configuration
